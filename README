Customised Lab Renderer with the following changes:

03/22/2017
+ Fixes shadows to work with Unity 5.5+ and reversed-Z
+ Added partial support for Unity's shadow bias controls (see ValveCamera.cs for note)
+ Adds ability to toggle shadow casting. As the Lab uses shader replacement for the shadow pass, it doesn't respect the Mesh Renderer's Cast Shadows toggle, so my solution adds the toggle to the vr_standard shader, making it material-based. The replacement shader then ignores it during the shadow pass rendering.
+ Adds support for alpha cutout shadows and semi-transparent shadows, using Unity's built-in dither pattern
+ Adds support for vertex colors, including alpha. This means the matrix palette skinning bone indices are now passed in TEXCOORD3 (I'm unsure if this breaks anything? Unity's hardware skinning is kind of opaque and it's difficult to tell if it's enabled or not)

Original README follows:

The Lab Renderer

Valve’s VR renderer used in The Lab (Valve’s VR launch title for the HTC Vive). 

This is the set of scripts and shaders that drove rendering in The Lab. It is a forward renderer with support for up to 18 dynamic shadowing lights in a single pass with MSAA enabled, and it included the Adaptive Quality system that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution to maintain framerate in VR. 

Requires Unity 5.4.b15 or newer.
